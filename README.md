# Random Sentence Generator
This is a C++ program that generates random sentences given a grammar file!
The included grammar file is called 'Trump.g' and it uses direct quotes
and likely phrases to generate sentences that would likely be spoken, or
have been spoken by the 45th president of the United States.
